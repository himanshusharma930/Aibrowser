# Browser Tools Test Results Summary

## 1. browser_drag_and_drop
- **Status:** Failed
- **Details:** Failed to execute drag and drop functionality on multiple test sites (TradingView, W3Schools, Google). The browser_drag_and_drop function consistently returned errors indicating "Script failed to execute". This may be due to limitations in how these specialized functions work within the current browser environment or restrictions in the implementation.

## 2. browser_set_zoom
- **Status:** Failed
- **Details:** Failed - browser_set_zoom, browser_pinch_zoom, and keyboard mouse combo zoom methods all returned errors: "Script failed to execute" or similar. These tools appear to be non-functional in the current environment.

## 3. browser_pinch_zoom
- **Status:** Failed
- **Details:** Failed - Both browser_pinch_zoom and browser_set_zoom functions returned errors: "Script failed to execute" and "Browser view not available" respectively. These browser tools are not functioning properly in the current environment.

## 4. browser_keyboard_mouse_combo
- **Status:** Partially Failed
- **Details:** Testing of browser_keyboard_mouse_combo functionality showed mixed results. While I was able to simulate keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+K and Tab using browser_press_key, direct testing of the browser_keyboard_mouse_combo function was not successful. The function appears to have issues with parameter passing. However, basic keyboard combinations (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) work when used individually with browser_press_key. For comprehensive testing, a more robust implementation of the keyboard mouse combination functionality would be needed.

## 5. browser_scroll_horizontal
- **Status:** Partially Failed
- **Details:** Tested browser horizontal scrolling functionality. The standard browser_scroll function with direction 'right' worked successfully, scrolling 300px horizontally. However, the dedicated browser_scroll_horizontal function consistently failed with "Script failed to execute" errors. This suggests that while horizontal scrolling is technically possible through standard browser controls, the specialized horizontal scrolling tool is not functioning properly in this environment.
