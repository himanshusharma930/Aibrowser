- Mac: Hot & freezing

**After:**
- RAM: 685MB (66% reduction!)
- Processes: 13 (normal)
- Mac: Cool & responsive

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### Critical (This Week)
1. Move TTS to server-side API route
2. Wrap app with ErrorBoundary
3. Fix TypeScript errors gradually

### Important (This Month)
1. Add input validation to IPC handlers
2. Implement code splitting
3. Setup CI/CD
